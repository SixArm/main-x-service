### Match

The matching system compares two records:

- Output: Produces a confidence level probability score 0.00-1.00.
- Configurable scoring: Customizable match thresholds and weights

Matching strategies:

- Probabilistic matching: Advanced fuzzy matching algorithms
- Deterministic matching: Rule-based exact matching

Algorithms:

- Jaro-Winkler similarity: 0.00-1.00, case-insensitive, prefix-bonus
- Jaro-Winkler weighted field-by-field: 0.00-1.00, case-insensitive, only fields present in both records contribute
- Haversine distance with sigmoid decay: geo matching
- Soundex phonetic matching: 4-character code, applied as bonus +0.05 if Soundex match and score < 0.95

### Duplicate detection

- Batch duplicate detection
- Real-time duplicate checking during record registration (returns 409 Conflict)
- Explicit duplicate-check endpoint
- Threshold-based automatic vs manual review
- Similarity scoring algorithms
- Confidence scoring for match quality (certain/probable/possible)
- Configurable matching rules (threshold, max_candidates, auto_merge_threshold)
- Review queue persisted in a `review_queue` table with status tracking (`pending`, `confirmed`, `rejected`, `automerged`) and confirm/reject decision endpoints (person / worker / place / thing / organization)
