## 10. Open questions

The following design questions are deliberately unresolved. Proposing a resolution is welcome; do so in a PR rather than a unilateral code change.

- **OQ-A — Category hierarchy.** `PlaceCategory` is flat; should an ancestor-level hierarchy allow partial credit (e.g. `Cafe < FoodService`)? Trade-off: explainability vs recall.
- **OQ-B — Country-code canonicalisation at construction.** Should `PlaceBuilder::country_code_as_iso_3166_1_alpha_2` uppercase and validate at construction, or preserve round-trip honesty as today?
- **OQ-C — Multi-polygon / area definitions.** `area_as_metre_2` is scalar. Should `Place` gain an optional polygonal extent (WKT, GeoJSON, `Vec<(f64, f64)>`) and a point-in-polygon / overlap scorer?
- **OQ-D — Locale-aware street-type vocabulary.** Should `expand_street_abbreviations` gain locale vocabularies for `rue` / `straße` / `via` / `calle` / `straat`? If so: opt-in field, Cargo feature, or always-on?
- **OQ-E — Phonetic-encoder choice.** American Soundex is English-tuned. Add Double Metaphone or Daitch-Mokotoff behind a Cargo feature, default unchanged?
- **OQ-F — `local_id` scoring opt-in.** Should a caller be able to opt in to scoring `local_id` when comparing records from a single source?
- **OQ-G — Address `line2`, `county`, `country` scoring.** These are stored but not scored (§6.4). Should they contribute, and with what sub-weights?
- **OQ-H — Per-category default for `coordinates_scale_metres`.** The `50.0` m default suits venue precision; dense urban chains may need a per-category default.
