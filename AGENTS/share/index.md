## Spec-driven development — single source of truth

Every service crate carries its own `spec.md` as the **canonical
artefact**. Code conforms to the spec; not the other way around.

- A behavioural change PR has **three parts**: spec edit + code edit
  + test edit. All in one PR.
- The live work queue for each crate lives in its `spec.md §13`.
- Open questions live in `spec.md §16` until resolved.
- See `<crate>/AGENTS/spec-driven-development.md` for the discipline.

Per-crate `spec.md`:

- [person-service/spec.md](../../person/person-service-rust-crate/spec/index.md)
- [event-service/spec.md](../../event/event-service-rust-crate/spec/index.md)
- [worker-service/spec.md](../../worker/worker-service-rust-crate/spec/index.md)
- [place-service/spec.md](../../place/place-service-rust-crate/spec/index.md)
- [thing-service/spec.md](../../thing/thing-service-rust-crate/spec/index.md)
