# AGENTS — Event Service

How to work in this crate. The canonical artefact is
[`spec.md`](spec/index.md). When in doubt, the spec wins. See
[`agents/spec-driven-development.md`](agents/spec-driven-development.md)
for the discipline this crate practises.

## Durable event bus — outbox relay + `FluvioSink`

`src/relay.rs` is the Phase-3 outbox relay (spec §13 T-11): it drains
`event_outbox` rows to an `EventSink`, default `LoggingSink` (no
broker; dev/CI). The real-broker sink, `FluvioSink` (BUS-3, ported
from case-service's BUS-1 reference), lives behind this crate's own
`fluvio` Cargo feature — **off by default**, so a default build's
dependency tree and behaviour are unchanged. Both the relay loop
(`EVENT_EVENT_TRANSPORT=outbox` + `EVENT_EVENT_RELAY`) and the sink
(`EVENT_FLUVIO_ENDPOINT`) are off unless explicitly configured; an
endpoint configured **without** the `fluvio` feature refuses to start
the relay (logged at `error`) rather than silently marking rows
published without reaching a real broker. `compose.fluvio.yaml` +
`Dockerfile.fluvio-cli` provision a local Fluvio broker for opt-in
manual runs — not part of any automated CI stage; run the crate's
default `cargo test --lib` / `--features fluvio` variants and the
DB-gated suite as usual, and see `tests/fluvio_relay.rs` for the
feature-gated, `#[ignore]`d live-broker round-trip.

## Container image

`Dockerfile` (multi-stage, Debian 13 slim runtime) builds this crate's
production image. **Build context must be the repository root**, not
this directory — this crate's sibling path dependencies
(`integrity-mac`, `authentication-verifier`; its matcher,
`event-matcher`, is a crates.io registry dependency, not a path
dependency) live outside `event/event-service-with-loco/`:

```sh
podman build -f event/event-service-with-loco/Dockerfile \
  -t event-service .   # run from the repository root
```

Verified end-to-end (2026-08-03): builds clean, boots against a real
Postgres, and `GET /api/health` returns `200`. Like person's, this
crate's Dockerfile pre-dated the family's repo-root-context convention
and had the same four bugs, found only by running the built image:
no `config/` copy (boot crash: "no configuration file found in folder:
config"); `CMD` with no `start` subcommand (the loco CLI just prints
`--help` and exits 0); no `LOCO_ENV` (would boot in `development`
inside a `production` image); and a dead `SERVER_PORT` env var — loco's
own config reads `PORT`, not `SERVER_PORT` (the latter is a separate,
unrelated surface this crate's own `src/config/mod.rs` documents for
non-loco code paths). All four fixed; `PORT=8080` is now set
explicitly.

See `.containerignore` at the repository root (excludes every crate's
`target/`, or the build context would try to copy hundreds of GB of
build artifacts). The wired multi-service `examples/compose/` stacks
(DEP-1) that build on this are not yet written.

## Doc hierarchy quick reference

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `spec.md` | **Single source of truth** — what, how, status, tasks (§13) |
| `README.md` (symlink to `index.md`) | User-facing intro — must stay consistent with the spec |
| `AGENTS.md` / `agents/*.md` / `CLAUDE.md` | How to work in the repo + per-topic reference. `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line `@AGENTS.md` include (matching the family convention — see root `AGENTS.md`), not a second user-facing doc; its content used to duplicate `index.md` and has been folded/removed rather than kept in sync by hand. |
| `index.md` | Navigation aid with worked examples |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Historical record of releases and changes |
