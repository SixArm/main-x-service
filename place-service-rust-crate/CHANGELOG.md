## [Unreleased]

### Added — matcher bridge

- New `src/matching/adapter.rs` exposing
  `to_matcher_place(&service::Place) -> place_matcher::Place`.
  Projects the FHIR/schema.org-shaped service record into the matcher
  crate's builder shape: name flattening (`HumanName` → flat
  `given_name`/`family_name`/`middle_name`), telecom sampling
  (first phone / sms / email of each system),
  identifier routing by FHIR-style `system` URI (schema.org / FHIR system URI → matcher scheme enum
  with type-based fallbacks), GLN, FIPS, GNIS, OSM IDs and address field
  renaming (`state` → `county`, `postal_code` → `postcode`).
- `src/matching/mod.rs` now re-exports the sibling `place-matcher` crate
  as `matcher_lib`, so callers can reach `MatchingEngine`,
  `MatchConfig`, `MatchResult`, `MatchBreakdown`, `Confidence`, and
  every public matcher type without taking a separate dependency.
- Field-routing rules are inline-documented in `adapter.rs` and
  pinned by `tests/duplicate_detection.rs`.

### Added — tests

- New `tests/duplicate_detection.rs`. Black-box bridge tests that
  drive service records through `to_matcher_place` and assert on
  the canonical `MatchingEngine::match_places` output. Covers
  identical clones, name typos (Jaro-Winkler), deterministic
  short-circuits (national / strong identifiers), negative cases
  (unrelated records, divergent demographics), per-adapter field
  routing, and config-preset invariants (strict ⊆ lenient).

### Added — bridge benchmarks

- New `benches/bridge_bench.rs` (Criterion). Three groups:
  `bridge_adapter_only` (projection cost on minimal vs. rich
  records), `bridge_end_to_end` (adapter + engine call), and
  `bridge_one_to_many` (single query vs. 10 / 50 / 100 candidates).
  Regression guard for the duplicate-check hot path.

### Added — observability

- New `src/metrics.rs` exposing a process-wide `LazyLock<Metrics>`
  Prometheus registry. Standard counters
  (`place_created_total` / `_updated_total` / `_deleted_total` /
  `_matched_total`, labeled `http_requests_total`) and histograms
  (`http_request_duration_seconds`, `place_match_score`,
  `place_search_duration_seconds`).
- New `GET /metrics.prom` route on the web router serving Prometheus
  text-exposition format (`text/plain; version=0.0.4`). The
  canonical `/metrics` continues to render the HTML dashboard;
  configure scrapers with `metrics_path: /metrics.prom`.

### Added — UI

- `assets/static/css/themes/` ships 39 standalone Lily Design System
  themes (light, dark, dracula, nord, cyberpunk, … + four
  United Kingdom NHS variants). The layout's theme picker now lists
  all 39; default is `light`. Selection swaps the `<link href>` of
  `<link id="lily-theme-css">` at runtime; persisted in
  `localStorage["lily-theme"]`. The command palette also lists all
  39 themes.

### Changed — Loco background jobs

- Dropped the `bg_redis` and `bg_sqlt` features from the `loco-rs`
  dependency. Background jobs are now backed exclusively by
  PostgreSQL (`bg_pg`), using the same database as application data
  — no external Redis broker. `config/development.yaml` and
  `config/production.yaml` updated to `queue.kind: Postgres` with
  `uri: DATABASE_URL`. Removes the `rusty-sidekiq` →
  `redis 0.22.3` future-incompat warning chain.

### Changed — documentation

- Reduced healthcare / clinical / patient / hospital / clinician /
  practitioner framing across spec.md, AGENTS.md, AGENTS/*, README,
  CLAUDE.md, and index.md. Preserved: FHIR R5 resource and field
  names (e.g. `Patient.birthPlace`, `Practitioner` resource),
  national-identifier proper nouns (United Kingdom National Health
  Service Number, Australia IHI), paper citations, the
  `compliance-for-healthcare.md` doc, and `HIPAA` / `NHS` / `PHI`
  as compliance regimes.
- `spec.md §11 Testing Strategy` now lists the bridge integration
  tests; `AGENTS/testing.md` gained a `## Bridge Integration Tests`
  section; `AGENTS/restful.md` gained adapter + Prometheus blocks;
  `index.md` gained a worked example showing the canonical bridge
  in action.

### Fixed

- The place-matcher crates.io 0.3.0 API drift (Sweden personnummer
  renamed from `se_personnummer` to `se_workernummer`,
  `united_kingdom_national_health_service_number` shortened to
  `uk_nhs_number`) is now caught at the matcher level by each
  matcher's `tests/adapter_contract.rs` — see the matcher
  CHANGELOG.
