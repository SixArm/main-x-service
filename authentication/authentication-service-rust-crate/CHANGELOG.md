## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Inaugural scaffold (v0.1.0).** The Main X Index family's central
  single sign-on provider and reference loco.rs application.
  - Real loco.rs 0.16 app generated via `loco new` (Postgres,
    Postgres-backed queue, no asset tier).
  - **Passwordless magic-link** flow: `POST /api/auth/signup`,
    `POST /api/auth/magic-link`, `GET /api/auth/magic-link/{token}`,
    `GET /api/auth/me`, `POST /api/auth/signout`.
  - **RS256 JWT** issuance with a self-contained `src/auth` module
    (`jsonwebtoken` + `rsa`), and a **JWKS** endpoint at
    `/.well-known/jwks.json` so peer services verify tokens offline —
    no shared secret, no introspection hop.
  - **sessions** table (`jid` = JWT `jti`) for real signout/revocation,
    honoured locally by `/me` and `/signout`.
  - Console magic-link delivery in development (SMTP disabled); env-based
    RSA key configuration with a committed dev keypair under
    `config/keys/`.
  - DB-free unit tests covering the sign/verify roundtrip, JWKS shape,
    and rejection of tampered/garbage tokens. Green `cargo build`,
    clippy clean.

### Notes

- Loco's generated request tests (`tests/`) still reflect the starter's
  password flow and require Postgres to run; reworking them for the
  magic-link surface is tracked in spec §13.
